Problem: I am getting a super long console log server side in my first post 
request.

Solution: When I was working with my request object on the serverside, I made
the mistake of working with the entire request, not the request.body.  This was
throwing an error because I was trying to pass around the entire request. DON'T
FORGET ABOUT BODY. Double check that you're using req.body.
